# Project Title

## Overview

This project is a Node.js application designed to interact with YouTube videos, providing users with the ability to ask questions about the content of a video and receive answers generated by an AI model. The application leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries, making it a powerful tool for video analysis and content exploration.

## Features

- **Video Transcript Retrieval**: The application can fetch the transcript of a YouTube video, enabling it to understand the content of the video.
- **Embedding Generation**: It generates embeddings from the video transcript, which are used to represent the video content in a format that can be processed by the AI model.
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Users can ask questions about the video, and the application will generate responses based on the video's content.
- **User Interaction**: The application supports interactive user input, allowing users to ask questions and receive responses in real-time.
